# kisaanconnect-local
A web-based platform that connects local farmers with bulk buyers for planned procurement of agricultural products by enabling direct discovery and coordination.

## Platform Statement
Farmers in villages face difficulty in selling their produce at the right time and price,while local buyers such as wedding caterers,hotels,and vendors struggle to source vegetables in bulk with certainty.Existing systems like mandis are physical and reactive ,offering no mechanism for advance planning or local-level coordination.

There is lack of a simple digital platfomr that enables farmers, buyers, and local aggregators to coordinate agricultural supply and demand before the actual requirement date.


## Solution Overview
kisaanconnect-local is a village -level digital coordination platform where multiple farmer post their available products and the timeline of its avalability and buyers will contact those farmers from the platform by analysing its rating and reviews and then decide to buy the product after contacting with farmer.

The platfomr focuses on advance plannng , reduces wastage and improved transparency without replacing existing mandi system.
